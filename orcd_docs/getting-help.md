# Getting Help

## Additional Documentation

Engaging documentation can be found on these pages. If you haven't found your answer for other systems elsewhere in these pages, your answer may be in the documentation for the system you are using:

- [Satori Documentation](https://mit-satori.github.io/)
- [SuperCloud Documentation](https://supercloud.mit.edu/)
- [OpenMind Documentation](https://github.mit.edu/MGHPCC/OpenMind/wiki)

## Email

If you can't find your answer in the documentation, please use one of the email lists below to contact us. With the exception of SuperCloud, these lists will create a ticket that our team can assign and track. In all cases these mailing lists includes the entire team, so the best available person to answer your question will respond. Sending email to the entire team will also likely get you the fastest response. Please do not send email directly to individual team members.
